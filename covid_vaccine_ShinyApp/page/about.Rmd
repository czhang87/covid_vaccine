### Indicators

* COVID-19 Epidemiology
  - Cases per 100k Last 7 Days Moving Average
  - Test Positivity Rate Last 7 Days Moving Average
  - Hospitalizations per 100k Last 7 Days Moving Average
  - Percentage of ICU Occupied by COVID-19 Patients
  - Deaths per 100k Last 7 Days Moving Average
* COVID-19 Vaccination
  - At Least One Dose
  - Fully Vaccinated 
  - Booster (or Additional) Dose
  - Percentage of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy
* Contexts for Inequality Analysis
  - Metro Status: Metro and Non-metro
  - CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI): community vulnerability to disaster, disease outbreak, and etc.
  - COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC): supply- and demand-related challenges that hinder the vaccine coverage in the U.S.

The [CDC Social Vulnerability Index](https://data.cdc.gov/stories/s/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19/cnd2-a6zw/) and [COVID-19 Vaccine Coverage Index](https://data.cdc.gov/stories/s/Vaccine-Hesitancy-for-COVID-19/cnd2-a6zw/) are used as the context of disparity/inequality anaylysis in this Shiny App. 

The CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) summarizes the extent to which a community is socially vulnerable to disaster. The factors considered in developing the SVI include economic data as well as data regarding education, family characteristics, housing language ability, ethnicity, and vehicle access. SVI values range from 0 (least vulnerable) to 1 (most vulnerable). The SVI can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39); Moderate (0.40-0.59); High (0.60-0.79); Very High (0.80-1.0).

The Surgo Covid-19 Vaccine Coverage Index (CVAC) captures supply- and demand-related challenges that may hinder rapid, widespread COVID-19 vaccine coverage in U.S. counties, through five specific themes: historic undervaccination, sociodemographic barriers, resource-constrained healthcare system, healthcare accessibility barriers, and irregular care-seeking behaviors. The CVAC measures the level of concern for a difficult rollout on a range from 0 (lowest concern) to 1 (highest concern). The CVAC Index can also be categorized as follows: Very Low (0.0-0.19), Low (0.20-0.39), Moderate (0.40-0.59), High (0.60-0.79), or Very High (0.80-1.0) Concern.
